# Game Client

### How to start?

This library is a single JavaScript file, and you reference it with the HTML `<script>` tag
(notice that the `<script>` tag should be inside the `<head>` section):

```
<head>
    <script src="https://client.codyfight.com/lib/client.js"></script>
</head>
```

Alternatively, you can use the [client script](https://client.codyfight.com/lib/client.js) to host it locally or on a server.
